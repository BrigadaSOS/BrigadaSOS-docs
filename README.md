# Brigada SOS Website

![](https://uptime.davafons.com/api/badge/4/status)

Created with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and deployed with [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).

## Install

```
npm run install
```

## Build

For a watch server that gets hot-reloaded automatically, useful for writing docs:

```
npm run start
```

To build and serve a local copy of the page (same as the production environment)
```
npm run build && npm run server
```

## Deploy

Commits deployed to `main` branch will get automatically deployed to the main website by Netlify. Use Pull Requests for proposing and previewing changes before merging directly.
